            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Of the yeeres that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of Persia reigned: of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Authors therein &amp; of the diuersitie &amp; confusion of the names of the said Monarchies.</head>
                  <p>The difference of authors as well Historiographers, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors of the holy Scriptures, is great touching the time, and yeres that the two Monarchies of the Babylonians. and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans continued, and also touching the names of the Monarchies herein described: wherein there is great confusion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other opinions set apart wee will herein follow Iude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and Merasthenes ancient authors, whose opinions doe neerest agree with the holye Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Cirus hauing conquered the kingdome of the Medes against Astiages, left the said kingdome to his vncle Darius, by whose ayde he took Babylon, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Monarchie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon to the Persians. Two yeres after the said Darius returned into Mede, and Cirus reigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in Babylon: Then he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued war against the Scithians, and marched toward them, and in the meane while. left Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bises his son King of the country in his absence, according to the custome of the Persians, which was to appoint the neerest of the Kings blood, to be King ouer the Country, when the king went out to fight against any strange nation. This is the cause why Cambises was not set in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue order of the Monarches. Neither is there any mention of two brothers that were Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, which guilefully vsurped the Kingdome, but their ginie being knowne, they continued but a few months, and Darius sonne to Histaspis was chosen King.</p>
                  <p>Xerxes the sonne of the said
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176984:25"/> Darius succeeded him, but is not here placed in the number of the Monarchies, for that he left his Kingdome to Darius long-hand his sonne according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Persians, when hee went to warre against the Greekes. The Greekes Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers not respecting that custome number the said Xerxes and Cambises aboue-mentioned, among the said Monarchies, successiuely in order, which is the cause that they count more yeers in the said Monarchie, that is to say, <hi>226,</hi> yees.</p>
                  <p>As touching these confused names, ye shall vnderstand that among the Persians, Darius si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth he that subdueth, Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes a Warriour, Artaxerxes a great Warriour. Also that this name Assuerus is drawne from the Hebrewes, in steed of Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes, further that Artaxerxes was the common name of all Kings of Persia, as Pharao was the common name of all the Kings of Egypt, and Cesar of the Romish Emperours.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when you finde any indifferently named Darius or Artaxerxes, or both together, that is the cause of the difficulty, how to vnderstand vnder what King that hapned which is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the said bookes of Esdras, Nehemias, Esther, Daniel and other places of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except you will marke them and well vnderstand the contents of this Table.</p>

               <p>FOr better vnderstanding of the Contents of this Table, ye shall note that the Euangelists S. Mathew and S. Luke, haue diuersly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the generation of our Sauiour Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dgin to the flesh, and yet tende both to one ende, that is to proue (that according to that which is written of him in the prophesies) he is descended of the Royall blood of Dauid, and rightly succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in the Kingdome. So the diuersitie of the said recitall consisteth in this, that S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew setteth forth the said generation descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the father to the sonne, and S. Luke ascendeth from sonne to father, which come all to one end. But to shewe the agreement of Saint Luke with S. Mathewe, we haue here set forth the generation by him described, descending af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of S. Mathew, to the end that the one may be conferred with the other: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. S. Mathew describeth the generation of Ioseph, though it belong nothing to Iesus Christ, after the flesh, &amp; S. Luke that of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Marie: for it was very necessarie to recite both, forasmuch as women were commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of the line or kinred of their husbands and so as well of her husbands side as on her owne ofspring, it is manifest that she was of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall line of Dauid. <hi>1.</hi> Iuda of the line of Nathan engendred Simeon called Ioas, which came to the Royall Seate, because the posteritie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon failed in Ochosias, &amp; therefore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom belonged to Nathans posterity according to the ordinance of Dauid, as Philo reciteth, that is: the yongest of the children of Bersebe (which was Salomon) should reigne after him, and that if the posteritie failed, the Kingdome should come to the posteritie of the next younger, which was Nathan: and therefore Nathan was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ahiscar that is to say brother of the Prince, and they of his posterity Ahiscarun, that is to say brothers of the Prince, and Mathitim, which signifieth, Geuen to succeede. The said Philo reciteth, that the posteritie of the said Nathan was so honored of the King Iosaphat, that hee called his children the brothers of Ioram his son and their children the brothers of Ochosias his nephew: and this is the cause why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saieth that Ioas was the son of Ocho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, though he were not his natural son, but the sonne of Iuda descended of Nathan.</p>
               <p>Note that S. Mathew going about to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the generation by foureteens, did first leaue out Ieas, Amaziac, and Azarias, which are set in betweene Ochosias, the last of the race of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon and Ioashan: further hee hath left out Achaas, and Ioacim, placed between the same</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:176984:51"/>
               <p>Forasmuch as it seemeth that S, Luke maketh no mention of the generation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but rather of Ioseph, for he vseth these words, that Iesus was counted the sonne of Ioseph, which was of Heli, that is to say, the sonne of Heli: we must vnderstand that in this place the name of sonne is taken for the name of sonne in law to Heli, for that he tooke to wife the Virgin Mary daughter to the said Heli, which manner of speech is common in the Scripture: for we find that Noemi calleth Ruth her daughter which was but her step-daughter, her sonnes wife.</p>

                  <item>2. <hi>Dauid</hi> reioyceth, that albeit enemies and worldly powers rage, God will aduance his Kingdome euen to the farthest end of the world: therefore he exhorteth Princes humbly to submit themselues vnder the same; herein is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ and his Kingdome.</item>

                  <item>11.

                  <item>13. <hi>Dauid</hi> as it were ouercome with afflictions, flieth to God his onely refuge: encouraged through Gods promises he conceiueth confidence against the extreame horrors of death.</item>
                  <item>14. He describeth the wickednesse of men, so growne to such licentiousnes, that God was brought to vtter contempt; for which albeit he was greatly grieued, yet perswaded that God would redresse it, he is comforted.</item>
                  <item>15. Here is taught why God chose the Iewes his peculiar people, and placed his Temple among them, which was that they by liuing vprightly, might witnesse that they were his speciall and holy people.</item>

                  <item>21. <hi>Dauid</hi> in the presence of the people praiseth God for the victory giuen them against the Sirians and Amonites 1. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 31. wherein he was crowned with the Crowne of the King of Ammon: 2. <hi>Samuel</hi> 12. and endued with the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold blessing of God.</item>
